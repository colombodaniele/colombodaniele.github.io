We identify a supply shock to the gas price in the Euro Area using market-relevant news and high-frequency data, as well as a demand shock exploiting exogenous variation induced in the price of gas by surface temperatures. These shocks have economically significant effects. Gas supply and demand  shocks exert significant impacts on both headline and core inflation. However, while gas supply shocks have a less pronounced effect overall, they elicit a stronger response in interest rates. We also document an important interdependence of the gas and oil markets, where shocks in gas and oil prices mutually influence both commodities.
We then quantify the contribution of the gas price shocks, together with oil price, global supply chain bottlenecks and monetary policy shocks on the realized series of inflation. We find that gas and supply chain bottleneck shocks have been among the major drivers of the recent inflation surge in the Euro Area. 
Finally, we identify the corresponding gas price shocks in the US and show that their macroeconomic effects are less severe compared to those in the Euro Area, also providing comparable estimates of the pass-through of gas and oil shocks in both regions.
